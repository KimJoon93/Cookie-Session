# Cookie-Session

## Before starting
When we start studying login in web programming, what we firstly met is Cookie & Session. We all knows about cookie. We erase cookie if internet seems slower than before. Before studying programming, What I all knows about cookie was just a file that has imformations. But when we make services that has login function we should think about security. And we can find about session in web programming. So Why Session? We could just use cookie when we login. It is very dangerous when information exist in web. These days information security is really important.
