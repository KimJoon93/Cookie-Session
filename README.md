# Cookie-Session

## Before starting
When we start studying login in web programming, first we face to Cookie & Session. We all knows about Cookie. We erase Cookie if internet seems slower than before. Previously, what I all knows about cookie was just a simple file that has imformations. But, there were more things to think about. Imagine we are making a simple service that has login function. Then We should think about remaining. There will be a lot of pages in one service. And if we login in to the service, all pages should know that we'd login before. So how does all pages know that you had login before?. We can't login all the time in every pages. After recognizing about this, then we can face to 2 important things. Cookie and Session. Everybody in internet says "Do not use Cookie in login!". So Why Session? Could we just use cookie if we want. It's because of security. It is very dangerous when informations exists in the web. We all knows information security is really important these days. It can be unnecessary things, but I wanted to check with my own eyes and code. So I started this project to check what happens when we use cookie and how does Session works.   

## Cookie
- I made a cookie project in Eclipse with Dynamic Web Project.

- I found simple login form from colorlib post by Aigars

- I download Login_v19 and put it in to my project. And erase some code I don't need. I only going to check how does cookie works. (Sometimes there are some problem with finding file. If it doesn't work you should check the path, so project could find your file.)

- Check it works!

## Session
- I made another project in Eclipse with Dynamic Web project. 

- I made a simple login page same as cookie project.
