# Cookie-Session

## Before starting
When we start studying login in web programming, first we face to Cookie & Session. We all knows about cookies. We erase cookies if internet seems slower than before. Before studying programming, What I all knows about cookise were just a file that has imformations. But, there are more things than we can think about. When we make services that has login function we should think about remaining. There will be a lot of pages when we make one service. And if we login in to that service, most pages should know we'd login before. So how do they know that is you. We can't login all the time in every page. After recognizing this, then we can face to 2 things. Cookie and Session. But everybody in internet says no Cookies! So Why Session? Could just use cookie if we want. It's because of security. It is very dangerous when information exist in the web. We all knows information security is really important. It can be unnecessary things, but I wanted to check with my own eyes and code. So I started this project.   

## Cookie
- I made a project in Eclipse with Dynamic Web Project.
 
- I made a simple login page and 

## Session
This time, We are going to use Session. 
I made another project in Eclipse with Dynamic Web project. 
I made a simple login page same as cookie project.
